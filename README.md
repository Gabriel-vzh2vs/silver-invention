SQL and Dashboard Development for a Simulated Car Company

This project aimed to improve the profitability of SOAC, a car repair company that currently uses an analog accounting method and a SQL database. We use streamlit, numpy, and AWS web services to create a dashboard that analyzes the data and answers four key questions:

How can we increase the amount of revenue per transaction?
How can we optimize salaries to reduce expenses while improving profit?
What columns most closely correlate with expenses, and how do we optimize them?
What is the ratio of all expenses over revenue aka profit margin?
The dashboard provides insights and recommendations based on the data analysis and helps SOAC make better decisions for their business.
